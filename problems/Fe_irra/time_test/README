Fe_cp1.i 
  reference time usage including all necessary kerenels
  time cost: 16 hrs
Fe_cp2.i
  goal: test cost of diffusion kernels  (remove diffusion kernel)
  time cost: 16 hrs
Fe_cp3.i
  goal: test cost of spatial dependent production sources  (use spatially constant sources)
  time cost: 16 hrs
Fe_cp4.i
  goal: test cost of functions in GGroup (_emit(), _disl(), _diff()) 
Fe_cp5.i
  goal: test cost of constant group constants within one group and use pre-calculated group constants
Fe_cp6.i
  goal: test the sources distribution
Fe_cp7.i
  goal: change intersitital cluster effective radius into equation same with void
Fe_cp8.i
  goal: test the effect of dislocation density
Fe_cp9.i
  goal: test the sources distribution

**Summary: 1. spatial dependent production sources and diffusion kernel don't addition noticeable computation cost
           2. make group constants available beforehand and simplify the calculations in GMobile.C, GImmobileL0.C, and GImmobileL1.C saves a lot of time (compared Fe_cp4.i(30+hrs) Fe_cp5.i(1min)). Also the results are very similar
           3. total number of defects in terms of point defects is too large. Plus void swelling peak is not consisent with experimental results
           4. the number of nodes doesn't change answer much (negligible 50 nodes vs 80 nodes)
           5. change effective capture radius of loop to void doesn't change answer much
           6. a rough estimation shows that the dislocation density term becomes negligible among all terms. Eg. rho * D * C1 << 4 * pi * r * D * C1 * C2
           7. diffusion kernel makes it easier to converge and the results almost the same from comparison!!!
